<h3>Stop 2: Student Drop-in Help Desk (IST 209)</h3>
<h5>Staff rostered on this desk can help to answer questions in the topic areas of COMP, ENGR, MATH & STAT. It’s best to check the opening times at <a href="http://www.csem.flinders.edu.au/students_current/">http://www.csem.flinders.edu.au/students_current/</a> and to see when someone is rostered on for your topic area (currently planned to open in week 2 of the semester).</h5>
<h4>How to get to Stop 3:</h4>
<h5>When you leave Stop 2, Stop 3 will be immediately on your right when exiting the help desk. (Not the computer lab) This is shown on the map below.</h5>
